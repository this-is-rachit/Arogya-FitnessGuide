## üöÄ Getting Started & Local Setup

To get a local copy of the entire project up and running, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites
* **Node.js** (v18.x or newer recommended)
* **npm** (comes with Node.js)
* **MongoDB:** You need a running instance of MongoDB. You can use a local installation or a cloud service like MongoDB Atlas.

### 1. Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone [https://github.com/this-is-rachit/Arogya-FitnessGuide.git](https://github.com/this-is-rachit/Arogya-FitnessGuide.git)
cd Arogya-FitnessGuide
```

### 2. Backend Setup
The backend server is the core of the application.

1.  **Navigate to the backend directory:**
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    The `--legacy-peer-deps` flag helps resolve potential version conflicts in the dependency tree.
    ```sh
    npm install --legacy-peer-deps
    ```
3.  **Create the environment file:**
    Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory and populate it with your credentials.
    ```env
    MONGO_URL=your_mongodb_connection_string
    JWT_SECRET_KEY=your_super_secret_key_for_users
    JWT_ADMIN_SECRET_KEY=your_super_secret_key_for_admins
    DB_NAME=arogya
    COMPANY_EMAIL=your_email_for_nodemailer_if_used
    CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_cloud_name
    CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key
    CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_cloudinary_api_secret
    NUTRITION_API_KEY=your_nutrition_api_key
    ```
4.  **Start the backend server:**
    ```sh
    nodemon
    ```
    ‚úÖ The backend server should now be running on **`http://localhost:8000`**.

### 3. Frontend Setup (User App)
1.  **Navigate to the frontend directory**
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    npm install --legacy-peer-deps
    ```
3.  **Create the environment file:**
    Create a `.env.local` file and add the backend API URL.
    ```
    NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_API=http://localhost:8000
    ```
4.  **Start the frontend server:**
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```
    ‚úÖ The user application should now be running on **`http://localhost:3000`**.

### 4. Admin Panel Setup
1.  **Navigate to the admin directory**
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```sh
    npm install --legacy-peer-deps
    ```
3.  **Create the environment file:**
    Create a `.env.local` file and add the backend API URL.
    ```
    NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_API=http://localhost:8000
    ```
4.  **Start the admin server on a different port:**
    To avoid port conflicts with the user app, run the admin panel on port `3001`.
    ```sh
    npm run dev -- -p 3001
    ```
    ‚úÖ The admin panel should now be running on **`http://localhost:3001`**.
